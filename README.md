developed by NVIDIA, is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing. It is particularly influential in areas requiring high-performance computing (HPC), such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, where it accelerates neural network training and inference.
